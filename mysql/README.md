Its use has many benefits, such as allowing web applications to run without an Internet connection and improving the performance of related applications by increasing the speed at which content is loaded. Personal Information: Information provided to us by a user that can be used to personally identify the user, such as name, phone number, address, or other data for which we can legitimately find such information through a link.
